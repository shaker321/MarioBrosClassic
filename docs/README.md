# MarioBrosClassic

## MVP
I will create the classic Mario Bros arcade game. The absolutely necessary features are
* [ ] Different floors
* [ ] Mario
* [ ] Turtles
* [ ] Interactions between Mario and turtles (they flip over when Mario hits the floor beneath them then Mario can kick them dead, turtles kill Mario if he touches them, etc.)
* [ ] Lives
* [ ] Landing Page with directions
* [ ] High Score and Current Score

## BONUS
* [ ] POW button to flip all turtles for a short span of time
* [ ] Coins that can be collected for bonus points
* [ ] Turtles come out of pipes
* [ ] Spike balls that can kill Mario

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
I plan on using React to create my game. I anticipate that the most difficult challenge will be to get the turtles and Mario to both move and interact. I intend to deal with this by using listeners on specific keys and a coordinate system to detect whether the objects are touching.
